# DeterministicTransport

This code solves the neutron transport equation in slab geometry for two groups 
using the deterministic Sn method.

Two test problems (Tests A and B) that simulate interaction of uranium
and  MOX  fuel  assemblies.   There  are  two  half-assemblies  next  to  each
other  with  reflective  boundary  conditions  on  the  outside.   A  MOX  fuel
half-assembly is on the left and a uranium half-assembly is on the right
(see Figure 1).  Each assembly contains only one kind of fuel pin cells, with
8 pin cells per assembly.
